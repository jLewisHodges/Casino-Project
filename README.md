# Casino-Project
Program that represents a Casino made entirely in Java.
This is a early release of the Casino Project. In this release, accounts are stored locally as the program is run. 
Meaning that there is no file output everything is temporary and will be deleted when program is exited.

Functionality:
User Accounts and admin accounts are present.
Two games are included: Black Jack and Slots.
Can deposit and cash out funds.

Because this is an early release there may be some bugs. If you do find any bugs you can report them here on github under 
this repository. Feel free to contribute to this project if you would like.

To run this program you will need the Run.bat file and release .jar file. They will both be in the v1.0 folder after extracting the zip folder. In addition, you will need an up to date java jre or jdk. All you need to do is double click the Run.bat file
